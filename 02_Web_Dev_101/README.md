##### V. Discussion - Project #1 Due Week 5 (Tuesday 09/30)
* Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). An example of a mashup that pulls together data from two different apis is the InstaTimes example provided here in the class repo. Ulitmately, it's up to you what you want to build. But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

##### VI. Homework
* Read - [Javascript section of Ch.3 - Interactive Data Viz for the Web by Scott Murray](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) up to but not including the section on SVGs
* Read - [Javascript 101](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/) up through the section on Functions
* Watch - [Lynda.com: Javascript Essential Training Section 2 - Core Javascript Syntax (56 mins)](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Watch - [Lynda.com - Introducing the Javascript Language: Section 6 Functions - Basic Uses of Functions (4 mins))](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Install - A JS Linter for your Text Editor (I use [Sublime Linter](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/identify-code-errors-sublime-linter/) for Submlime)
* Complete & Upload - answers to the 3 code exercises at the end of [Eloquent JS 2nd Edition Preview Ch.2 - Looping A Triangle, FizzBuzz, & ChessBoard](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html). The upload should include a .html file and a .js file. Your javascript code answers should be written (as functions) in your .js file and executable in the browser console. In your .html file, you only need to write some basic markup stating the names of the 3 functions to run in the console. 
* Think & Post - idea(s) for Assignment #1, this should include at minimum a paragraph description of what you're thinking about doing, how the data flow might work, and what the experience of a user visiting the site would be like
