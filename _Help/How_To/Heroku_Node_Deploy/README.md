How to Deploy to Heroku
-----------------------

#### Step 0 - The App
* Create a Node-Express App that runs locally on your machine. (If you don't have an app, see any of the examples in the "Back_To_The_Server" folder.)
* Make sure your application runs locally without any errors. Check all the routes, check all the clicks, check all the console statements. If there are issues locally, there will be issues when your application tries to run on Heroku.

#### Step 1 - The App Config
* In the app.js file add an "environment" variable called `port`  

	```
	var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
	```    
	This will allow Heroku to set their own port value. For our application, if no port value is set by the environment, the default port value will be 3000.  
* Next, update the `app.listen` method to have `port` as its argument.  

	```
	app.listen(port);
	```    
	Also, if you have a console statement that explicitly prints out the port number, you should update that as well to use the new port variable.  

	```
	console.log('Express started on port ' + port);
	```    
* Create a file named `Procfile` in your applications's main directory. In this file, add a line of code that will instruct Heroku how to run your application. The line should start with `web: node` and then be followed by the name of your application's main serverside javascript file. In this example, the file I call to launch my application is `app.js`. So, I need to add:  

	```
	web: node app.js
	```     
	Essentually, Heroku needs to know how to run our application. So this will be the command Heroku will use to do just that.
* In the `package.json`, make sure it is complete and accurate. In particular, make sure the `node engine` is set to the current LTS version (i.e. `node": "^8.9.1"`). Also, the `name` value in the `package.json` should not have any spaces!
* Create a file named `.gitignore` in the app's main directory and add this line of code to the file  

	```
	node_modules
	```    
	This will exclude the node_modules folder from your git repository. Note, the `.gitgnore` file may not appear in your finder directory. If you are on a Mac running OSX, you should also include `.DS_Store` on the next line in the `.gitignore` file. 
* If you are linking to any **external** client-side javascript or css libraries, such as jquery, underscore or google fonts, make sure the src/href value is set to `https`. Heroku will yell at you if it is not `https`. This is specifically for 3rd party hosted files (i.e. files that are not hosted within your own application). You may also get an error if you are making a client-side AJAX request to an http url. Update the url to https, but test first to make sure it still works.  
* Lastly, consider commenting out any unnecessary or lengthy `console.log` statements on both the server and the client to prevent any performance issues.

#### Step 2 - The Git Repo
* Install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) (skip if already installed)
* In Terminal, set up your `git config vars` - you only have to do this once (skip if already set up)

	```
	git config --global user.name "YOUR_FULL_NAME"  
	git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
	```  
* Navigate (`cd`) to your app's main directory in Terminal
* Create a git repository and commit your app by executing the following commands in Terminal

	```
	git init
	git status -s  
	git add -A
	git status -s
	git commit -m "First commit"
	git status -s
	```  
* At anytime it is helpful to execute `git status` or `git status -s` for a "short-hand" version of the state of the git repository.
* If you are only interested in adding a specific file to the git repository, you can type `git add FILE-NAME` to add only this specific file
* When you first run `git add -A`, you should NOT see any files with the extensions declared in your `.gitignore` file.
* It is fine to change file and folder names. When you run the `git add -A`, it will attempt to update the directory
* Prior to running git commit, if there is a specific file that has been added that you do not want to commit, you can type `git reset FILE-NAME` and it will unstage it.
* If you make a commit and want to go back to the previous commit, you can run `git reset HEAD~1`.

#### Step 3 - The Heroku Site
* Create an account on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
* Download and Install the [Heroku CLI Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/). 
* In Terminal in your app's main directory, first type `heroku` and press enter. It should run an initial install.
* Next, login to Heroku by typing 

	```
	heroku login
	```  
	You will be asked to click any key and directed to a web page to login. After you login, return to the Terminal.
* You are now ready to create an empty Heroku app repo by typing:

	```
	heroku create my-app-name
	```  
	* Note, what you enter for `my-app-name` will be part of your app's url. So, if I enter `heroku create mysuperawesomeapp`, the url Heroku assigns to my app will be `http://mysuperawesomeapp.herokuapp.com`
* After creating the app, type `git remote` to confirm the app was created and has been added as a remote repository. It should list `heroku` as a remote. You can also check your heroku account's "Apps" page to confirm the app was created and added to your account.
* The last step here is to push (i.e send) the app files to heroku by executing the following command

	```
	git push heroku master
	```  
* Once the push is complete, your site should be live at `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/`
This url will also print out to the Terminal after your push is complete
* If you would like your app to use a "custom domain", meaning your own url, Heroku's [Custom Domains Page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains) will help step you through doing this.
* For an alternative step-by-step guide to deploying on Heroku, go to [Getting Started with NodeJS](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)

#### Step 4 - The Updates
* To update your app at any time, you will need to (1) update your local git repository and then (2) push the updated files to Heroku. This can be done by executing the following commands in Terminal in your app's directory

	```
	git status -s 
	git add -A 
	git status -s 
	git commit -m "Updated the app"`
	git push heroku master
	```  
* For the `git add` step you can also add files individually by executing

	```
	git add FILE-NAME
	```  
* If you navigate to your app, which you can do by typing `heroku open` in the Terminal window, you should see your updated application.
