#### V. Discussion - Project #1 Due Class 10 (Thurs 10/05) 
* Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

#### VI. Homework
* Review - [CSS Positioning 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101)
* Watch - [Lynda.com: Javascript Essential Training Section 2 - Core Javascript Syntax (56 mins)](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Watch - [Lynda.com - Introducing the Javascript Language: Section 6 Functions - Basic Uses of Functions (4 mins))](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Read - [MDN - Javascript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)   
* Install - A JS Linter for your Text Editor. I use [Sublime Linter](http://www.sublimelinter.com/en/latest/index.html) with Sublime. See [How To Install Linter]() for specific instructions.
* Answer - the 3 code exercises at the end of [Eloquent JS 2nd Edition Preview Ch.2 - Looping A Triangle, FizzBuzz, & ChessBoard](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html). Create a .html and .js file. Your code answers should be written in the .js file as functions. Try to link your .js file to your .html file so that the functions can be run in the browser console when you load the .html file. In your .html file, you only need to write some basic markup stating the names of the 3 functions to call in the console.
* Begin - working on Project #1
