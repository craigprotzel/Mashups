Mashups: Student Work
===============================

Assignment #1 - Class 09 (Thursday 09/29)
-------------------------
Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). An example of a mashup that pulls together data from two different apis is the InstaTimes example provided here in the class repo. Ultimately, it's up to you what you want to build. But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

Final Project - Class 28 (Thursday 12/15)
-------------------------
Your final project will require creating a single web page experience that combines (1) data from at least one public web API and (2) data submitted by users that is stored in your own databse. Your final project should be uploaded to the web before class and should incorporate the following elements:  
* a public web API as a data source
* a client-side js library other than jQuery and/or Underscore
* server-side code (i.e. Node-Express)
* data-storage (i.e. CouchDB on Cloudant)
* at least one route that returns json data to the page  

In terms of 'data-storage', the idea is that a user will somehow contribute (i.e. input data) to your application. User input can come in many forms including but not limited to requests, comments, reviews, links, media, feedback, high scores, solutions and more. The input could be available only to that user through a personal link or could affect the entire experience of the application. It is up to you to decide!
